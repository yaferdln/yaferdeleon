  <p>Hi, I’m Yafer — a Web Developer with a background in <span class="text-slate-100">IT Support</span> and a strong entrepreneurial mindset. I began my career as an IT Support Assistant at the <span class="text-slate-100">Manila International Airport Authority</span>, where I developed a solid foundation in technical troubleshooting and problem-solving. This experience sharpened my ability to think critically, work under pressure, and deliver effective solutions.</p>
  <br>
  <p>My involvement in business and <span class="text-slate-100">cryptocurrency</span> has also helped me become more adaptive, resourceful, and user-centered — qualities that now drive my approach to software development. I currently focus on <span class="text-slate-100">Frontend</span> development, building responsive and modern interfaces using <span class="italic">HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, and Tailwind CSS.</span></p>
  <br>
  <p>To become a more versatile developer, I’m expanding my skills in <span class="text-slate-100">Backend</span> technologies like <span class="italic">Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL</span>. This full-stack knowledge enables me to build complete and scalable web applications.</p>
  <br>
  <p>I’m driven by a desire to create meaningful digital experiences and continuously grow through hands-on learning and collaboration. Whether working independently or in a team, I bring focus, discipline, and a strong commitment to delivering quality results. <span class="text-slate-100">Let’s connect and create impactful solutions together.</span></p>
