  <p>Hi, I’m Yafer — a Web Developer with a background in IT Support and a strong entrepreneurial mindset. I began my career as an IT Support Assistant at the Manila International Airport Authority, where I developed a solid foundation in technical troubleshooting and problem-solving. This experience sharpened my ability to think critically, work under pressure, and deliver effective solutions.</p>
  <br>
  <p>My involvement in business and cryptocurrency has also helped me become more adaptive, resourceful, and user-centered — qualities that now drive my approach to software development. I currently focus on Front-End development, building responsive and modern interfaces using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, and Tailwind CSS.</p>
  <br>
  <p>To become a more versatile developer, I’m expanding my skills in Back-End technologies like Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL. This full-stack knowledge enables me to build complete and scalable web applications.</p>
  <br>
  <p>I’m driven by a desire to create meaningful digital experiences and continuously grow through hands-on learning and collaboration. Whether working independently or in a team, I bring focus, discipline, and a strong commitment to delivering quality results. Let’s connect and create impactful solutions together.</p>
