export const aboutText = `Hello, I'm Yafer — a passionate Web Developer with a background in IT Support and entrepreneurship. I worked as an IT Support Assistant at <span class="text-slate-300 font-semibold">Manila International Airport Authority</span> for two years, where I developed strong technical skills and a problem-solving mindset. My experience in business and cryptocurrency also helped me become more adaptable and user-focused.

I'm currently focused on <span class="text-slate-300 font-semibold">Front-End development</span>, building clean and modern interfaces using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Tailwind CSS, and Bootstrap. To become a more well-rounded developer, I'm also learning Back-End tools like Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL. I believe that having both front and back-end skills allows me to create more complete and impactful solutions.

This is an exciting chapter in my career, and I'm eager to apply what I’ve learned to real-world projects. With a strong work ethic and clear goals, I’m looking forward to contributing to meaningful digital experiences and growing through collaboration. Let’s build something exceptional together!`;
